	<h1>Spain's History Project 2</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Spain's powerful world empire of the <time datetime="1500-01-01">16th</time> and <time datetime="1600-01-01">17th</time> centuries ultimately yielded command of the seas to England. Subsequent failure to embrace the mercantile and industrial revolutions caused the country to fall behind Britain, France, and Germany in economic and political power. Spain remained neutral in <abbr title="World War I">WWI</abbr> and <abbr title="World War II">WWII</abbr> but suffered through a devastating civil war (<time datetime="1936-07-17">1936-39</time>).</p>
	<p>A peaceful transition to democracy following the death of dictator Francisco FRANCO in <time datetime="1975-11-20">1975</time>, and rapid economic modernization (Spain joined the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> in <time datetime="1986-01-01">1986</time>) gave Spain a dynamic and rapidly growing economy, and made it a global champion of freedom and human rights. More recently, Spain has emerged from a severe economic recession that began in mid-2008, posting solid years of <abbr title="Gross Domestic Product">GDP</abbr> growth above the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> average. Unemployment has fallen but remains high, especially among youth. Spain is the euro-zone's fourth-largest economy. The country has faced increased domestic turmoil in recent years due to the independence movement in its restive Catalonia region.</p>
